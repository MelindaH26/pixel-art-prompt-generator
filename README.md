# Pixel Prompt - The Pixel Art Prompt Generator

## Description
This project was build as part of the CodeCademy Back-End Engineering course. I wanted to make a fun program to generate a prompt for when a pixel artist is stuck on what to draw.

## Features
This Project generates a random subject, colour scheme, canvas size and optional additional challenge to base your artwork on.

## How to use
Down load the project, extract the files and open the index.html.

## Future updates
I plan to update this project in the future to provide smarter working prompts and functionality to regenerate only a single part of the prompt. I would also like to look into ways of how to generate actual colour pallets and display them on the screen.
